    <h3>About Myself</h3>
    <p>
      <b>M</b>y name is Ethan Benoit. I'm twenty years old and as of writting this, I am a second year student at St. Lawrence College.
      I've gotten into gaming at the age of four when my grandmother one day introduced me to a Super Nintendo console she had in her house and a few
      game cartridges for it. Ever since then with the new game consoles and games I get for either Christmas or for my Birthday,
      I've wanted to make my own video games one of these days. Then one day, an opportunity struck me at the age of fifteen when I went to my very first comic book convention known as Cape which
      is a smaller scale of the well known Comic Con for the city of Cornwall, there was a booth that was presenting a sort of game demo, it immediately caught my attention.
      It turned out to be a college program showing off their student's projects to the attendants including myself. One of the representitives approached me and talked about this Game Programming course this
      college had to offer, and without hesitation, I knew what I wanted to do with my future. With that in mind, i've managed to power through the obstacles of high school until I had
      eventually got ahold of my diploma.
